## To Compile Typescript into Javascript

```
Download typescript and node use tsc (typescript compiler)

- To compile the file automatically use with -w flag

~ $ tsc pro.ts -w
```

## The issue with script execution

On windows when the script execution isn't allowed tsc won't work so you have to enable it, it can be done by using the
following command on powershell

```
~ $ Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
